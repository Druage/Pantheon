This frontend has no C++ logic at all is just a mockup until I learn C++ and code it myself, 
or someone else wants to help.

Major:
	Create a QML window that has retroarch running inside of it.
	
Minor:
	Finish MenuBar.
	Get rid of the vertical white line from SplitView.
	Make frontend themeable.
	Make the headerbar in the TableView the same color as the rest of the table.
	Fix overall polish and make the frontend surpass OpenEmu's
	
May end up creating:
 	Create a QML window that allows controller mapping, but since the RGUI already has that,
	I may put this one off until the end.
