##The Rebirth of a Desktop U.I.

This is a "rebirth" of the RetroArch Phoenix project that was deprecated. 
This is to provide RetroArch with an all-in-one graphical interface that focuses on desktop use. 
RGUI is a great interface for your console and t.v. however, I believe that it lacks speed when traversing the menus.
This project is so far a clone of the [OpenEmu](http://openemu.org/) frontend. Please show support for their hard work. 
This project will provide a lot of the functionality that they have provided, and more. 
Furthermore, this project is unofficial and so please directy questions about the frontend to me, since the
RetroArch developers will not know what you are talking about.
The official version of is located at this [site](http://www.libretro.com/).
You can contact me at Druage@gmx.com.

To run this program you need [Python 3.3](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.3/), [Qt 5.2](http://qt-project.org/downloads) libraries, and a [pyotherside](http://thp.io/2011/pyotherside/).
This will work on Linux, OSX, and Windows. No binary packages currently exist because I haven't create any yet.

If you would like to contribute to the project please message me.

###Things that still need to be completed.

1. Have game artwork scrubber work.
2. Add controller mapping from within the frontend.
3. Make Rating system work.
