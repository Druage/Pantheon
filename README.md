# RetroarchPhoenix


##Rebirth of a desktop U.I.

This is a "rebirth" of the RetroArch Phoenix project that was deprecated. 
This is to provide RetroArch with an all-in-one graphical interface that focuses on desktop use. 
RGUI is a great interface for your console and t.v. This project is so far a clone of the 
[OpenEmu](http://openemu.org/) frontend. Please show support for their hard work. 
This project will provide a lot of the functionality that they have provided, and more. 
Furthermore, this project is not affiliated with the official 
[RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch) developers. 
However I did like the Phoenix part.
