# RetroarchPhoenix


##A rebirth of a desktop U.I.

This is a "rebirth" of the Retroarch Phoenix project that was deprecated. This is to provide Retroarch with an all-in-one graphical interface that focuses on desktop use. RGUI is a great interface for your console and t.v. This project is so far a clone of the [OpenEmu](http://openemu.org/) frontend. Please show support for their hard work. This project will provide alot of the funtionality that they have provided, and more. Furthemore this project is not affiliated with the official [RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch) developers. However I did like the phoenix part.

Project was written with Qt 5.2
