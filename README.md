##The Rebirth of a Desktop U.I.
![Image](resources/images/phoenix.png) 



This is a "rebirth" of the RetroArch Phoenix project that was deprecated. 
This is to provide RetroArch with an all-in-one graphical interface that focuses on desktop use. 
RGUI is a great interface for your console and t.v. This project is so far a clone of the 
[OpenEmu](http://openemu.org/) frontend. Please show support for their hard work. 
This project will provide a lot of the functionality that they have provided, and more. 
Furthermore, this project is not affiliated with the official 
[RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch) developers. 
However I did like the Phoenix part. You can contact me at Druage@gmx.com.

To run this program you need [Python 3.3](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.3/) installed and the Qt 5.2 libraries along with pyotherside. I'm working on an installer.
Then just run the main.py. I am still ironing out the bugs and I have only tested this latest build on Windows 8.1, I will test it for Linux in a few days

~~Also for win32 users, place a retroarch-megapack in the root directory and rename it to retroarch_v1.0~~ <i>Not needed anymore.</i>

###Things that still need to be completed.

1. Have game artwork scrubber work.

2. Make Rating system work.
3. ~~Work on sold theme. I'm currently working on that.~~ Basically finished

###Future Goals:
1. Add advanced settings. <i> Currently in development. </i>
2. Have RetroArch pass OpenGL video and sound to QML Window.
